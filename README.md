# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Challenge

In this module, a javascript code was written to help build an interactive dashboard that analyzes a dataset of belly buttons. The index html and samples were already provided and have been included in the repository, while the app.js was written to include a bar chart, a bubble graph, and a dropdown menu that is interactive and allows the user to look at the information of certain subjects included in the data. I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment. I also worked with classmates Mia Hursh and Kiet Hoang on parts of this code.
